##  Storing data
1. Create an account on (algolia.com)
2. Create an application: get started> top left - create an application
(3. rename in bottom left -settings>application>rename
4. go to the application again
5. create index(basically where data is stored )> index name capital( check the naming convention as shown)
6. upload data in the index in the form of JSON either enter manual JSON or you can upload a JSON file  [ you can use (www.mockaroo.com) json generator for product data or anything ]
7. Now your data is uploaded so you can manipulate it to do that 
8. First go to configuration>facets 
What are facets?
Basically, widgets that we create include lists, menus, refinement lists with checkboxes, range-sliders, menus, etc.
You can check how these facets look like here in [Algolia Showcase](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/widgets/showcase/js/)
